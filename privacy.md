**The instance is guaranteed to be running an exact copy of the code made open source.** The version may not be the latest available (check `/about`), but no local changes will be made. This may change, but users should be notified in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HmSMT4WKKV) about such change.

You may check the source code and see how the data is managed, in addition to the following policy.

## What data is collected

TangleDex collects the following data from Discord:

- User IDs, this is used to identify you inside our database
- Server (or guild) IDs, this is used to store settings necessary to the bot's operation
- Channel IDs, this is used to know in which channel should the collectibles spawn

In addition, the following data proper to TangleDex is created and used:

- The list of collectibles owned by a user of the service
- A history of trades done on collectibles, including the users that once owned the said collectible but do not anymore

## How the data is stored

All data is stored on a PostgreSQL server, running on a Virtual Private Machine hosted by Oracle Corporation.

Interaction between the bot and the database server is exclusively local using [Tortoise ORM](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm).

## Access to the data

The only persons allowed to access the data are the application owners.

Any application owner may interact with the bot and the administrator interface. Only `reictangle` has direct access on the host machine.

The TangleDex moderation teams do not have access to the data.

The data may never be made available to the public, and its access must be secured accordingly.

## Your rights

You may request a copy or the deletion of your personal data held by the application by contacting the application owners. The recommended way is sending an email to "TangleDex (at) reichtangle (dot) gmail (dot) com ".
